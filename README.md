# Rag
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs) using the LlamaIndex Python library and OpenAI APIs.

Key Features
Data Ingestion & Indexing: Ingests data from various sources such as PDFs, text files, and databases, and constructs vector indexes to efficiently organize and retrieve knowledge.

Embedding Generation: Utilizes OpenAI's powerful embedding models (e.g., text-embedding-ada-002) to encode documents into semantic vectors enabling relevant document retrieval.

Natural Language Querying: Supports natural language questions that are answered by retrieving pertinent context and augmenting LLM generation responses.

LLM Integration: Seamlessly integrates with OpenAI's GPT models for advanced language understanding and generation capabilities.

Modular and Scalable Architecture: Designed to be extendable with additional vector stores, embedding models, and data connectors, supporting custom workflows.
Environment Configuration: Employs OpenAI API keys stored securely in environment variables, facilitating safe and scalable usage of OpenAI's services.

Usage Overview
Load documents into the system using LlamaIndex's readers.

Create vector store indexes from these documents with embeddings generated via OpenAI.

Query the index to get accurate, context-rich responses using an LLM.

Leverage this pipeline to build knowledge assistants, chatbots, and AI applications that combine retrieval and generation with accuracy and flexibility.
